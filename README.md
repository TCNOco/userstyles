# TroubleChute's Userstyles

I like darkmode stuff.

I also like using websites other users creating skins abroad may not use, such as local South African websites.

Why not create some nice darkmode custom user CSS to use with plugins like [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html)?

I love the [Dracula](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme) and [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/userstyles) colours, so you'll see a lot of that here.

Also, this is entirely a passion thing. It may work, it may not. Websites can change at any time without notice, and sometimes are hard to work with because of css naming choices, or changes.
